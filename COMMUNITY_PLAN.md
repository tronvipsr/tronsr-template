Our plan is simple - **We will only pay out to the first 125,000,000 votes each cycle**.  Our reward system is geared to Tron holders that are looking for a modest return on investment. We think this will benefit the tron community as a whole by encouraging people to vote for others, once our 125MM votes are acheived.  We can not control how many votes we receive, we can control who gets the rewards.We have given ourselves a 25MM buffer, so that as votes change - we shouldn't fall below the 100MM line.

Our plan is evolving.  Our team is new.  We will be updating our site soon with more details.
