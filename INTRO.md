TronVIP is made of crypto-enthusiasts who see Tron as the next wave of crypto-currency. We are a small team of technology experts based in the Midwest region of the US. Between us, we have 20+ years of professional experience in network engineering, sofware development, server management, and SaaS architecure design and deployment. We've built datacenters, the software that runs datacenters, and services that get served by those datacenters.

**REWARDS**

This is where TronVIP differs from other SR's.  **We will only pay out to the first 125,000,000 votes in each vote cycle**.  The problem with voting as it stands today is that as the SR's get more votes, your returned rewards go down.  We want to keep the voting rewards as high as possible as a return on your investment to us.   We do not expect to be at the top of the SR leaderboard, but we do want to be in the top 27 and contribute to block generation.
