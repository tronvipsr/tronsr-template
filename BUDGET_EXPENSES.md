We are currently developing a complete financing model to show TRX value vs. admin fees for the reward system.  The goal is to reduce the admin fees as the price of TRX rises.

Currently, our model is simple:

13% of rewards will go to covering hosting costs.

5% will go to pay the team.

82% will go back to the voting community.
